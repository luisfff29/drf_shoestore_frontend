This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Shoe Store FrontEnd

Display the app [React](https://reactjs.org/) with this repository: [https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_frontend](https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_frontend/]) using an API from a Django REST framework [https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api](https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api/]) named and created Shoe Store.

## Installation

To start using the React app you should follow first the process from the API repository: [https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api](https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api/])

## Start up

_Don't forget to run first the server Django API and then start the React app._

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to start the app
